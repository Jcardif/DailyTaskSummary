Here is the summary of the work done

Good evening team,

Here's a summary of the tasks accomplished by Peter Parker today:

Checked watercooler moderation which involved responding to emails and checking for additional interesting topics.
Worked on Synapse Blog 2, designing PowerBI dashboards, and reviewing what goes to OSDC blogs.
Please note that not all tasks are tracked in ToDo & DevOps, so this might not represent the entire work done for the day. Peter will provide any missing information later.

Thank you, and have a great evening!
